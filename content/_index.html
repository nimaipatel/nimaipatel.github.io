    Hello, I'm an engineering student in my sophomore year from India. I'm
    primarily interested in Linux and Unix based operating systems and the C
    and C++ programming languages. I also have quite a bit of experience with
    fullstack web development.
</p>

<p>
    This website documents my experiences with technology (and maybe other
    things in the future). Hopefully, you'll find something useful here.
</p>

<p>
    This is a static site which runs no JavaScript at all, so you can be sure
    that I'm not sending any creepy http requests back to a server I (or
    someone else) owns.
